### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an experienced software engineer that's worked in the worlds of:

* server administration
* full-stack web development
* cloud infrastructure
* devops
* CI/CD platform management
* and most recently: 
  * high scale kubernetes workloads.

I've recently started learing about data science and am excited to get deep into coding again!

I'm also interested in gaming of all kinds, so expect some games related repositories to pop up here as well ðŸ˜„
