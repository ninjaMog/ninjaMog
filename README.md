# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

### About Me

I'm an experienced software engineer with many years experience in:

* server administration
* full-stack web development
* cloud infrastructure
* devops
* CI/CD pipelines & platform management
* and most recently: 
  * high scale kubernetes workloads.

I've recently started learning about data science and am excited to get deep into coding again!

I'm also interested in gaming of all kinds, so expect some games related repositories to pop up here as well ðŸ˜„

### My projects

* [Titanic - Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/ninjaMog/titanic_EDA) - An interesting exercise that was part of my Data Science boot camp, I perform a basic Exploratory Data Analysis on a subset of the titanic passenger dataset, to try and determine what factors led to the best chance of survivability!

  Github provides a pretty good preview of the produced [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/ninjaMog/titanic_EDA/blob/main/titanic.ipynb)
* [simple security groups](https://github.com/ninjaMog/simplesecuritygroups) -  This was a handy little tool I enjoyed creating to help remove the tedium of writing out Cloudformation security group rules when working at Orange Digital as a Cloud Engineer 10 years ago in the early days of AWS!

  It's now very redundant thanks to excellent "Infrastructure as Code" (IaC) tooling like [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) (Thank goodness! ðŸ˜„)

### My forks

* [clair](https://github.com/ninjaMog/clair/tree/integration) - I needed to apply a few quick fixes to get this open source image vulnerability scanner running at the time we were trying it out at Anaplan
* [flexdmd](https://github.com/ninjaMog/flexdmd) - One of many open source components of the virtual pinball software scene, I have a local fork so I can trigger github action builds when I need to to build certain versions for my virtual table!
